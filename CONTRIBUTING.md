# Quick Contribution Guide

## What to do:

- Follow the typical contribution workflow (fork -> clone -> edit -> test -> push -> pull request)
- Make sure to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Explain your changes in the pull request
- Follow the same code style as the rest of the project

## What not to do:

- Make incomplete pull requests or changes
- Make changes that don't follow the code style
- Be rude or disrespectful
- Make changes that don't make sense (even though this sounds funny, it's a real thing)
- Ruin other people's work

And that's about it! If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the Discussions section.
